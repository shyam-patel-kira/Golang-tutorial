Floating Types
The predefined architecture-independent float types are −

Sr.No.	Types and Description
1	
float32

IEEE-754 32-bit floating-point numbers

2	
float64

The value of an n-bit integer is n bits and is represented using two's complement arithmetic operations.

Other Numeric Types
There is also a set of numeric types with implementation-specific sizes −

Sr.No.	Types and Description
1	
byte

same as uint8

2	
rune

same as int32

3	
uint

32 or 64 bits

4	
int

same size as uint

5	
uintptr

an unsigned integer to store the uninterpreted bits of a pointer value


Sr.No	Type & Description
1	
byte

Typically a single octet(one byte). This is an byte type.

2	
int

The most natural size of integer for the machine.

3	
float32

A single-precision floating point value.
