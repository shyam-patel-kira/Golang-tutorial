Features of Golang:
	The most important features of Go programming are listed below −

		Support for environment adopting patterns similar to dynamic languages. For example, type inference (x := 0 is valid declaration of a variable x of type int)
		Compilation time is fast.
		Inbuilt concurrency support: lightweight processes (via go routines), channels, select statement.
		Go programs are simple, concise, and safe.
		Support for Interfaces and Type embedding.
		Production of statically linked native binaries without external dependencies.

Features Excluded Intentionally
	To keep the language simple and concise, the following features commonly available in other similar languages are omitted in Go −
		Support for type inheritance
		Support for method or operator overloading
		Support for circular dependencies among packages
		Support for pointer arithmetic
		Support for assertions
		Support for generic programming
A Go program basically consists of the following parts −
	Package Declaration
	Import Packages
	Functions
	Variables
	Statements and Expressions
	Comments
